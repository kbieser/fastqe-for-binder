Garter snakes excrete sexually dimorphic pheromones to attract a mate. The hypothesis of their experiment is that male and female garter snakes host unique microbial communities in their mouths, cloacae and musk glands that contribute to sexually dimorphic bioengineering of these pheromone molecules. Figure 1 provides an overview of their 16S metagenomics analysis pipeline. For this lesson though, all you need are the FASTQ files. Feel free to substitute your own favorite FASTQ files for this activity if you like.  "
